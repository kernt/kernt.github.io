Progressive Delivery Operator for Kubernetes

## Safer Releases

Reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics like HTTP/gRPC request success rate and latency.

## Flexible Traffic Routing

Shift and route traffic between app versions using a service mesh like Istio, Linkerd, Kuma, OSM or AWS App Mesh. Or if a service mesh does not meet your needs, use an Ingress controller like Contour, Gloo, NGINX, Skipper or Traefik.

## Extensible Validation

Besides the builtin metrics checks, you can extend your application analysis with custom metrics and webhooks for running acceptance tests, load tests, or any other custom validation.
