Erklärung:

Aus dem Manpage

resolvectl is a multi-call binary. When invoked as "resolvconf" (generally achieved by means of a symbolic link of this name to the resolvectl binary) it is run in a limited resolvconf(8) compatibility mode. It accepts mostly the same arguments and pushes all data into systemd-resolved.service(8), similar to how dns and domain commands operate. 
Note that systemd-resolved.service is the only supported backend, which is different from other implementations of this command.
etc/resolv.conf will only be updated with servers added with this command when /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, and not a static file.
See the discussion of /etc/resolv.conf handling in systemd-resolved.service(8).
