**Ceph** is a distributed network storage and file system with distributed metadata management and POSIX semantics.

Ceph Storage Clusters consist of several types of daemons :

- a [Ceph OSD Daemon](https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/glossary/#term-Ceph-OSD-Daemon) (OSD) stores data as objects on a storage node
- a [Ceph Monitor](https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/glossary/#term-Ceph-Monitor) (MON) maintains a master copy of the cluster map.
- a [Ceph Manager](https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/glossary/#term-Ceph-Manager) manager daemon

A Ceph Storage Cluster might contain thousands of storage nodes. A minimal system has at least one Ceph Monitor and two Ceph OSD Daemons for data replication.

The Ceph **File System**, Ceph **Object Storage** and Ceph **Block Devices** read data from and write data to the Ceph Storage Cluster.

**Cephadm** Orchestrator creates a new Ceph cluster by bootstrapping a single host, expanding the cluster to encompass any additional hosts, and then deploying the needed services.

Requirements :

Python 3  
Systemd  
Podman or Docker for running containers  
Time synchronization (such as Chrony or the legacy ntpd)  
LVM2 for provisioning storage devices

Get the **version** from repository :

apt policy cephadm

Run `cephadm install`:

apt install cephadm

This is installing all the **dependencies** …

`apt policy cephadm`

**Note** : Do all of above command at **all nodes**.

Run the `ceph bootstrap` command :

```sh
cephadm bootstrap --mon-ip 192.168.56.143 --initial-dashboard-user admin --initial-dashboard-pass
```

The `cephadm shell` command launches a bash shell in a container with all of the Ceph packages installed :

```sh
cephadm shell
```

Confirm that the `ceph` command can connect to the cluster and also its status with :

```sh
ceph -s
```

To add each **new host** to the cluster :

```sh
cat /etc/ceph/ceph.pub
```

Tell Ceph that the **new node** is part of the cluster :

```sh
ceph orch host add Seph2 192.168.56.144  
  
ceph orch host add Ceph3 192.168.56.145
```

To add a **label** a existing host, run :

```sh
ceph orch host label add Seph2 _admin  
  
ceph orch host label add Ceph3 _admin
```

get the list of **nodes** & containers :

```sh
ceph orch host ls  
  
ceph orch ps
```

`cepth orch host ls`

`ceph orch ps | grep mon`

`ceph orch ps | grep cepth-mon`

check the **ports** (**6789** for ceph v1 & **3300** for ceph v2) :

`netstat -nltp | grep ceph-mon`

check the **services** :

`ceph orch ls`

To add **storage** to the cluster, you can tell Ceph to consume any available and unused device(s):

The `--dry-run` flag causes the orchestrator to present a preview of what will happen without actually creating the OSDs.

Run the below command twice :

```sh
ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices --dry-run
```

then run the main command :

`ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices`

check the cluster status :

`ceph -s`

ensure that the status is : **HEALTH_OK**

if you add 3 new hard disks to 3 nodes, ceph automatically adds them to **OSDs** :
