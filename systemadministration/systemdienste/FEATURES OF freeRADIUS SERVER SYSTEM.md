**FreeRADIUS** is one of the most advanced and developed servers in the world. It was founded in the year 1999 by Miquel van Smoorenburg and Alan DeKok. Over millions of users are using the server these days.

It is one of the most essential testing and monitoring tools used these days. It is actually used to check and keep a track of the server’s performance.

This server system comes inbuilt with all the RADIUS server system features, and one can use each of them. You can easily implement all the RADIUS characteristics and features with [**freeRADIUS**](https://modernmckinneyhomes.com/home-renovation/) as well.

Some of the features **freeRADIUS** offers are -

1. Performance and scalability
2. Operating system
3. AAA Functionality
4. Vendor dictionaries
5. Databases
6. Virtual servers

**1. Performance and scalability:**

It is one of the fastest server systems in the globe. And this is so because its unique modular design allows it to be stripped down its own structure for embedded systems.

Also, it supports the option to expose all its available features when needed.

**2. Operating system:**

**FreeRADIUS** runs on a vast variety of operating systems.

Every tiny thing about its structure is made to ensure smooth and clean processing, yet there are certain occasional moments where issues are developed in its functioning.

It supports every type of CPU and OS architecture.

**3. AAA Functionality:**

It also allows the authentication of all sorts of AAA and EAP-type systems. It does not just allow authentication but pre and post-authentication features as well.

**4. Vendor dictionaries:**

One can use and access over 100 vendor directories with **freeRADIUS**. All the basic and essential vendor equipment is supported in the system.

**5. Databases:**

The system is also a storehouse of all sorts of databases. And all the authorization, authentication, and accounting are supported as well.

**6. Virtual servers:**

**FreeRADIUS** is the only server system that supports and allows virtual servers. This feature of the system is almost similar to the Apache server system.
