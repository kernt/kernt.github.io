**Security Compliance Tools Supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**

- **OpenSCAP** — The **oscap** command-line utility is designed to perform configuration and vulnerability scans on a local system, to validate security compliance content, and to generate reports and guides based on these scans and evaluations.
    
- **Script Check Engine (SCE)** — SCE is an extension to SCAP protocol that allows content authors to write their security content using a scripting language, such as Bash, Python or Ruby. The SCE extension is provided with the openscap-engine-sce package.
    
- **SCAP Security Guide (SSG)** — The scap-security-guide package provides the latest collection of security polices for Linux systems.

The security or compliance policy is rarely written from scratch. **ISO 27000** standard series

The latest version of SCAP includes several underlying standards. These components are organized into groups according to their function within SCAP as follows:

**SCAP Components**

- _Languages_ — This group consists of SCAP languages that define standard vocabularies and conventions for expressing compliance policy.
    
    - The _eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)_ — A language designed to express, organize, and manage security guidance.
        
    - _Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)_ — A language developed to perform logical assertion about the state of the scanned system.
        
    - _Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL)_ — A language designed to provide a standard way to query users and interpret user responses to the given questions.
        
    - _Asset Identification (AI)_ — A language developed to provide a data model, methods, and guidance for identifying security assets.
        
    - _Asset Reporting Format (ARF)_ — A language designed to express the transport format of information about collected security assets and the relationship between assets and security reports.
        
    
- _Enumerations_ — This group includes SCAP standards that define naming format and an official list or dictionary of items from certain security-related areas of interest.
    
    - _Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)_ — An enumeration of security-relevant configuration elements for applications and operating systems.
        
    - _Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)_ — A structured naming scheme used to identify information technology (IT) systems, platforms, and software packages.
        
    - _Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)_ — A reference method to a collection of publicly known software vulnerabilities and exposures.
        
    
- _Metrics_ — This group comprises of frameworks to identify and evaluate security risks.
    
    - _Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS)_ — A metric system to evaluate security-relevant configuration elements and assign them scores in order to help users to prioritize appropriate response steps.
        
    - _Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)_ — A metric system to evaluate software vulnerabilities and assign them scores in order to help users prioritize their security risks.
        
    
- _Integrity_ — An SCAP specification to maintain integrity of SCAP content and scan results.
    
    - _Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD)_ — A set of recommendations explaining usage of existing specification to represent signatures, hashes, key information, and identity information in context of an XML file within a security automation domain.
        
    

Each of the SCAP components has its own XML-based document format and its XML name space. A compliance policy expressed in SCAP can either take a form of a single OVAL definition XML file, data stream file, single zip archive, or a set of separate XML files containing an XCCDF file that represents a policy checklist.
