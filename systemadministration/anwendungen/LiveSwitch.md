LiveSwitch Server makes [WebRTC](https://www.liveswitch.io/resources/ultimate-guide-to-webrtc)- and [SIP-compatible](https://developer.liveswitch.io/liveswitch-server/server/sip-connector.html) audio and video conferencing scalable, efficient, and truly cross-platform.

LiveSwitch provides unparalleled flexibility to combine peer-to-peer (P2P)-, Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)-, and Mixing Control Unit (MCU)-based media flows in a single session and switch dynamically while the session is live.

LiveSwitch provides a full cross-platform WebRTC stack. You can use the following exclusive features in your app:

- Token-based authentication
- Support for multiple simultaneous devices
- Powerful channel-based session management
- P2P, MCU, and SFU modes
- Support for H.264, VP8, VP9, G.711 and Opus codecs
- Presence management
- REST API and Webhooks control
- WebSocket-based media communication for the cases when WebRTC is blocked on the network (_Beta_, available for .NET and browsers only)

- SIP trunking
