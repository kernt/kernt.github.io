Sematext Core Infrastructure Monitoring
Sematext Infrastructure Monitoring provides complete insight into your infrastructure:

servers
Kubernetes clusters
containers
processes
inventory
events, etc.
For application and service monitoring, make sure to check our dedicated guide.

The centerpiece is an Infra App which acts as a container for all data about your infrastructure. As with other App types, you can create as many Infra Apps under your account as you wish.
